This is a project that I use for my own personal gain each and every attack launched within this project will be directed at my virtual machine (Metasploitable). Which is in my own virtual Network.

## My top 3 topics

1. Kali Linux       - Hacking
2. OpenStack        - Cloud
3. VPN Wireguard    - Networking/Firewall/Router

### Why are these my top 3 topics?

When I'm prompted with multiple topics that I have to choose from and make a project out of it. I always choose the topic that helps me the most. For example, VPNs are steadily gaining more reputation by the day. They are gaining relevance because people are gaining awareness and want to be safe on the internet, so they use a VPN or Virtual Private Network to be safe. They also use it to manipulate their Geolocation. So coming back to my initial response to this question, I choose my topics on how good they are and if the knowledge I gained from it could come in handy for me in the future.

## My chosen topic - Kali Linux - Hacking

In the end, I opted for the topic Kali Linux because I was always fascinated by it and knowing how it's done could help me prevent it and it could also help me understand how I can hack others. I explicitly want to highlight the word `prevention` of hacker attacks, because if I know how it's done I know how to prevent it. It is so crucial these days to have a base understanding of how to prevent basic attacks such as social engineering, phishing attacks and so on and so forth.

### Why did I choose this topic?

As previously stated in the text above I opted for this topic because I find it intriguing and quite a hot topic, especially in cyber warfare. Which I think will be the new way to wage wars. But enough let's get down to business.

## Structure of the project

My project will be structured accordingly. The first thing must be a table of content for the different files I use throughout this project. The second point in the table of content will be useful links I used and lastly I will link all sources I used throughout this project week. The sources will also be linked in the files.
